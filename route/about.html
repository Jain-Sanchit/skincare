                    The journey of
                    <strong>Dr Bhartiâ€™s Hair Skin & LASER Clinic</strong> began with
                    the aim to bring best and affordable Hair, Skin, Lasers and
                    Cosmetology practices under one roof and to let it come within the
                    reach of masses who otherwise hold a notion that skin treatment is
                    a costly affair. We began our journey with a small step starting
                    our first clinic at Vatsalya Polyclinic, Moshi, Pimpri Chinchwad,
                    Maharashtra in 2018. Over the last two years we catered to
                    thousands of patients in and around Moshi, and we are elated to
                    share that with honest and sincere efforts we were able to reduce
                    the suffering of masses and bring smile and confidence on many
                    faces. This fostered an everlasting impetus to our nurtured motto
                    further strengthening our commitment. And with soaring zeal and
                    belief we took another stride in our evolution and started our new
                    venture Shraddha Skin Clinic at Bhosari, Pune, Maharashtra in 2019
                    serving with same vigour and valour and to extend our services to
                    cover larger population with easy connectivity and
                    approachability. At our both centres all Skin and Hair treatments
                    are personally carried out by Dr Subhash Bharti, a practicing
                    Dermatologist & Cosmetologist who is continuously lending his
                    experience and acumen for last eleven years with perfect blend of
                    scientifically proven state of the art and recent technology to
                    enhance the aesthetic appeal of every patient in need.
